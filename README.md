# job-portal
This is a simple version of job portal where a employer can post a job with all relevant details of the job, and a candidate can see the list of jobs posted by the employers.
For Frontend ReactJs is used and for storing the data fake json server is used.

## How to install the project
You can either clone the project or download the folder.
After than open it in any code editor, I have used Visual Studio Code. Next, open run the terminal and run the command *npm install* to install all the node modules.

## How to use the project
As I am using fake json server for my database. So, to run the server run the command * npx json-server --watch data/db.json --port 8000*.
The end points are: "http://localhost:8000/jobs/"
